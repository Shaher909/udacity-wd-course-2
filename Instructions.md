# What's are we building?

You will be building a multi-section landing page

- Danymic navigation menu
- The section actively being viewed should be differentiated in some way
- When a user clicks on a navigation item, the item should scroll you to the appropriate section rather than giving you the default jump.

## Questions to think about

Whatâ€™s the ideal workflow?
How many files do I need?
Do I modify the HTML first or the CSS?
How many JavaScript functions do I need?
Should my function be this many lines of code?
Is readability or performance more important?
